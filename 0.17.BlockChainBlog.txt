🌐💡 Unveiling the Inner Workings of the Bitcoin Network! 🚀🔍

Did you know? Bitcoin has a total supply limit of 21 million, ensuring anti-inflationary resilience. But how do new bitcoins enter circulation? Let's unravel the process together! 🔄💰

🎁 Miners and Their Rewards:
The backbone of the network, miners are rewarded for creating new blocks. Their incentive? Transaction fees associated with each transaction. Over time, the reward has halved approximately every four years, currently standing at 6.25 bitcoins per miner. 🏆💲

💱 Bitcoin Transaction:
At the heart of the system, a bitcoin transaction is the transfer of bitcoin from one address to another. To ensure validity, the sender signs the transaction, which then spreads across the network. Each mining node diligently verifies the transaction. Subsequently, miners compile various transactions to form a block, constrained by the 1 MB block size limit of the Bitcoin blockchain. 🚀🔒

⌛ What's Next?
A race against time begins! Miners compete to solve a puzzle, seeking the perfect solution. Once discovered, the miner proudly publishes the block to other nodes. These nodes verify the block and add it to their own copy of the blockchain, ensuring a decentralized and secure network. 🧩📚

⏰ Time Taken to Solve the Puzzle: Approximately 10 minutes. ⌛
