  - No need for asset custodians
  - Transparent and deterministic execution of financial agreements
  - Seamless connectivity between applications

• Key DeFi properties:
  - Open-source code allows for public auditing
  - Reduced development and compliance costs
  - Bridges between distinct economic segments

• Permissionless composability:
  - Allows combination of different DeFi components
  - Developers can focus on unique business logic
  - Leverages existing open-source infrastructure
  - Enables faster innovation cycles and stronger network effects

### DeFi Applications:

• Stablecoins:

        - Core component of DeFi
        - Digital tokens representing fiat currencies or other assets on blockchain
        - Aim to maintain a 1:1 peg with the underlying asset
        - Aggregate value over $100B due to demand for stability in crypto markets

        • Types of stablecoins:
    
        1. Fiat-backed stablecoins:
            - Backed by off-chain collateral (e.g., TrueUSD)
            - Use Chainlink Proof of Reserve for on-chain audits

        2. Decentralized stablecoins:
            - Issued as overcollateralized loans using crypto collateral
            - Peg maintained through changing interest rates

        3. Algorithmic stablecoins:
            - Use cryptoeconomic mechanisms to maintain peg
            - Example: Fei Protocol

        • Fei Protocol example:
            - Functions like an algorithmic central bank
            - Uses Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) to maintain peg
            - Mints FEI against ETH deposits
            - Adjusts supply based on market price to maintain peg

• Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):

    • DEXs overview:
        - Allow instant access to liquidity for new tokens
        - Users can swap tokens without centralized entities
        - Interactions occur via non-custodial smart contracts

    • Automated Market Makers (AMMs):
        - A subset of DEXs
        - Major innovation in decentralized finance
        - Replace traditional central limit order books (CLOB)

    • Key features of AMMs:
        - Use on-chain liquidity pools instead of order matching
        - Allow instant swaps between tokens in the pool
        - Operate in a non-custodial manner

    • Liquidity provision:
        - Any user can become a liquidity provider
        - Earn passive income from trading fees

    • Advantages of AMMs:
        - Immediate liquidity for any digital token
        - Permissionless access
        - Contribute to price discovery in illiquid markets

    • Popular AMMs:
        - SushiSwap
        - Uniswap

    • Growth and future potential:
        - Significant increase in trading volume, users, and locked value
        - Ongoing improvements in:
            - Capital efficiency
            - Customizable liquidity provision
            - Mitigation of impermanent loss
        - Poised to attract more capital in the future

• Decentralized Money Markets:

    • Traditional money markets:
        - Fundamental component of economy
        - Connect borrowers and lenders
        - Generate significant economic activity
        - Typically facilitated by centralized entities

    • Decentralized money markets:
        - Enable permissionless borrowing and lending of digital tokens
        - Use blockchain-based smart contracts
        - Eliminate need for custodians

    • Key features:
        - Governed by open-source code
        - Managed by distributed stakeholders
        - Democratize supply and demand

    • Popular platforms:
        - Aave
        - Compound
        - CREAM

    • Benefits:
        - Non-custodial nature reduces single points of failure
        - Have processed tens of billions of dollars in value

    • Operational mechanism:
        - Rely on overcollateralization
        - Users deposit more collateral than they intend to borrow
        - Use on-chain price feeds from oracles to:
            - Determine users' collateralization ratios
            - Issue fair market loans
            - Liquidate undercollateralized positions
            - Calculate interest payments

• Synthetic Assets:

    • Definition:
        - Financial instruments deriving value from underlying assets or benchmarks
        - Example: Synthetic gold tracking the price of gold

    • Traditional context:
        - Creation typically limited to large institutions
        - Requires high degree of trust due to capital risk

    • DeFi innovation:
        - Permissionless framework allows anyone to build synthetic assets
        - Open-source financial primitives available to the public
        - Provides strong guarantees for intended execution

    • Key security aspect:
        - Access to high-quality, tamper-proof pricing data

    • Role of oracles:
        - Foundational infrastructure for synthetic assets
        - Provide reliable on-chain valuations
        - Essential for management of synthetic assets
        - Crucial for settlement of swaps

    • Importance of external data:
        - Management and settlement determined by external data sources
        - Emphasizes the critical role of oracles in the ecosystem

• Yield Farming:

    • Definition:
        - Also known as liquidity mining
        - New primitive enabled by DeFi

        - Incentivize liquidity for a project
        - Launch fair distribution of new tokens
        - Grow active and long-lasting community

    • Mechanism:
        - Rewards users who provide liquidity or contribute to protocol health

    • Primary goals:
        1. Bootstrap project usage
        2. Distribute governance tokens to a decentralized set of participants

    • Benefits:
        - Effective in kickstarting DeFi ecosystems
        - Cultivates network effects
        - Bootstraps supply-side liquidity
        - Creates community of stakeholders (primarily protocol users)

    • Characteristics of yield farming incentives:
        - Various forms based on individual project goals
        - Often leverage existing infrastructure
        - Establish unique reward schemes

    • Flexibility for developers:
        - Creative freedom in designing liquidity mining schemes
        - Can leverage distinct protocol parameters
        - Aim to create strongly aligned community of active stakeholders.

• Mitigating the Risk Factors of DeFi With Chainlink:

    • Blockchain oracle problem:
        - DeFi contracts often rely on external (off-chain) data
        - Secure transfer of data to and from blockchain is crucial
        - High-quality, tamper-proof data access has been historically difficult

    • Importance of data quality:
        - Smart contracts depend on the data they receive
        - Essential for maintaining a healthy DeFi ecosystem
        - Helps resist oracle manipulation attacks and outlier events

    • Risks of composability:
        - Allows faster iteration and interoperability
        - Can introduce systemic risk if faulty oracles are used
        - Connected "money LEGOs" are only as strong as the weakest link

    • DeFi use cases relying on high-quality external data:
        - Algorithmic stablecoins (e.g., FEI)
        - Money markets (e.g., Aave, Compound)
        - Synthetic asset protocols (e.g., Synthetix, dYdX)
        - Asset management platforms (e.g., Set Protocol)

        • Chainlink's role:
            - Serves as secure decentralized middleware
            - Connects on-chain and off-chain environments
            - Provides high data quality, security, and reliability
            - Helps reduce systemic risks in DeFi ecosystem
            - Enables user trust in smart contracts handling billions of dollars
