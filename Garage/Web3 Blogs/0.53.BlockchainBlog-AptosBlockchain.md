## What Is Aptos (APT)?

- Aptos, founded by Avery Ching and Mo Shaikh in October 2022, is a Layer-1 blockchain designed for scalability, safety, and reliability.
- Aptos uses the AptosBFT consensus mechanism built on the smart contract programming language Move.
- Move allows for the use of a parallel execution engine, known as Block-STM, for enhanced transaction throughput within the network, claiming to increase capability to 160,000 transactions per second (tps).
- Aptos requires a minimum of 1 million tokens in order to participate in the consensus. The Aptos consensus mechanism integrates PoS and BFT, and users can participate by staking Aptos without running a validator and choosing specific validators to stake with.
- Aptos achieves 160,000 tps, with a block finality less than one second.
- APT is the native token of the Aptos blockchain and is used to pay for transaction and network fees on the Aptos network.
- The APT token was launched on October 12, 2022, with an initial total supply of 1 billion tokens. Current circulating supply is 276.1 million tokens.
