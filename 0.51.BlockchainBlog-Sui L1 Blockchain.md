Heared about sui for the first time. Googled about it a little bit. Here's my findings:
- Sui is a L1 blockchain.
- Supports paralell processing of txns and horizontal scaling.
- Sui uses the programming language move, which is derived from rust.
- Sui enables the creation and trade of composable objects/NFTs
- Like miners in other blockchains, sui have validators but they have the ability to handle multiple txns in parallel results in more throughput, less latency, and more scalability.
- Traditional blockchain uses vertical scaling in which txns added one after the other, this makes txns slower.
- In sui, instead of sending every txn to every computer in the network it only shares a relevant part of the data that needs to check.
- The team behind Sui Network includes Evan Cheng, Adeniyi Abiodun, Sam Blackshear, George Danezis, and Kostas Chalkias, who are former Meta engineers.
- Suiâ€™s testnet launched in August 2022, and the mainnet went live on 3 May 2023.
- Main usecases of sui network:
    - In sui we can have expressive smartcontracts that give players true ownerhip of game assets opening window to infinite possibilities.
    - Decentralized social networks in Sui Network allows users to own their media, posts and interactions, while ensuring their verifiability.
- The network token of sui is known as SUI Coin which has a capped supply of 10 billion tokens in circulation
- Some Dapps built on top of sui:
    -  Cetus: Automated Market Maker (AMM) and DEX that focuses on offering concentrated liquidity and efficient capital deployment for DeFi users.
    - Cubic: Decentralized web3 gaming ecosystem.
    - HeroSwap: Instant, private, and anonymous cross-chain crypto swap platform.
